# Java Coding Challenge

This coding challenge is based on a feature we actually implemented in one of our products (but it is, of course, a very simplified version thereof). Hence it allows you to get a glimpse of our domain and the challenges you can expect when working at Camunda. And it allows us to get a sense of your programming style as well. Win / win! :-)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Build the project using Maven:
